<p>The known idea that is common across all Biology textbooks is that genetic mutations are random. This is the case because there is no cause that can prove evolution,
  therefore deeming it as random. However when we look at the meaning of random: </p>
<h2>ranÂ·dom<h2>
  
<h3>made, done, happening, or chosen without method or conscious decision. 
  alternate: unfamiliar or unspecified.<h3>
  
  <p>This can be our current answer to why genetic mutations occur the way that they do, but they aren't the real answer. The real answer is <strong> we don't know
    </strong> and this is what misleads us to believe that we do.</p>
